    text: `<p>
   In today’s AI-first world, the way people discover brands has evolved. Search engines are no longer the only gateway now, generative AI models like Google SGE, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Bing CoPilot curate and deliver answers directly to users. That’s where Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) comes in.

    </p><p>
    GEO is the new frontier of organic visibility. It’s the strategic practice of optimizing your brand content for AI-generated responses, voice assistants, and zero-click search experiences. Unlike traditional SEO, which competes for rankings, GEO positions your brand to be the default answer.

    </p><p>
    At IM Solutions, we are proud to be a leading GEO agency in India, trusted by innovative marketers and global enterprises alike. Headquartered in the tech capital, we are widely recognized as the best generative search optimization agency in Bangalore, delivering outcome-driven strategies that align with how people search, speak, and interact with AI.

    </p>
    <p>As the best GEO company in Bangalore, we don’t just optimize pages, we architect knowledge ecosystems that speak directly to large language models (LLMs). Whether you're targeting voice search, AI-assisted research journeys, or conversational interfaces, we ensure your brand is intelligently represented where it matters most.</p>
